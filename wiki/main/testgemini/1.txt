# Gemtext cheatsheet
Here's the basics of how text works in Gemtext:

Long lines get wrapped by the client to fit the screen
Short lines *don't* get joined together
Write paragraphs as single long lines
Blank lines are rendered verbatim
You get three levels of heading:

# Heading
## Sub-heading
### Sub-subheading
You get one kind of list and you can't nest them:

* Mercury
* Gemini
* Apollo
Here's a quote                  from Maciej Cegłowski:

> I contend that text-based websites should not exceed in size the      major works of Russian literature.
Lines which start with ``` will cause clients to toggle in and out of ordinary rendering mode and preformatted mode. In preformatted mode, Gemtext syntax is ignored so links etc. will not be rendered, and text will appear in a monospace font.
