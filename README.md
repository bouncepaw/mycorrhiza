## Features

* **No database required.** Everything is stored in plain files. It makes installation super easy, and you can modify the content directly by yourself.
* **Everything is hyphae.** A [hypha][feature-hypha] is a unit of content such as a picture, video or a text article. Hyphae can [transclude][feature-transclusion] and link each other resulting in a tight network of hypertext pages.
* **Hyphae are authored in [Mycomarkup][mycomarkup],** a custom markup language that's designed to be unambigious and easy to use.
* **Nesting of hyphae** is supported. A tree of related hyphae is shown on every page.
* **History of changes** for textual parts of hyphae. Every change is safely stored in [Git][integration-git]. Web feeds for recent changes included!
* **Keyboard-driven navigation.** Press `?` to see the list of shortcuts.
* **Support for [authorization][feature-authorization].**
* **[Opengraph][standard-og] support.**
* **Optional [Telegram][telegram] authentication.**
