# üçÑ MycorrhizaWiki 1.2
A wiki engine.

[Main wiki](https://mycorrhiza.lesarbr.es)

## Building
See [the guide](https://mycorrhiza.lesarbr.es/hypha/guide/deployment) on the wiki.

## Installing

### Pacman

If you use a linux distro with pacman package manager (Arch, Manjaro, Garuda, etc) you can install it using PKGBUILD:
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza/master/PKGBUILD
$ makepkg --install
```

### Docker

You can run Mycorrhiza Wiki in Docker using Dockerfile provided by this repository. Clone the repo and build the image:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza/
$ docker build -t mycorrhiza .
```

Now you can create a new Mycorrhiza Wiki container using this command:
```sh
$ docker run -v /full/path/to/my/wiki:/wiki -p 1737:1737 mycorrhiza
```

Example:
```sh
$ cd /dev/shm
$ git clone https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza/
$ docker build -t mycorrhiza .
$ git clone https://github.com/bouncepaw/example-wiki
$ docker run -v /dev/shm/example-wiki:/wiki -p 1737:1737 mycorrhiza
```

Example 2:
```sh
...
$ docker run -v /dev/shm/:/config -v /dev/shm/example-wiki:/wiki -p 80:1737 mycorrhiza -config-path /config/myconfig.ini /wiki
```
