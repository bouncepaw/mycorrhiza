## Features

* **No database required.** Everything is stored in plain files. It makes installation super easy, and you can modify the content directly by yourself.
* **Everything is hyphae.** A hypha is a unit of content such as a picture, video or a text article. Hyphae can [transclude] and link each other, forming a tight network of hypertext pages.
* **Hyphae are authored in [Mycomarkup],** a markup language that's designed to be unambigious yet easy to use.
* **Categories** let you organize hyphae without any hierarchy restrictions, with all the benefits of a category system.
* **Nesting of hyphae** is also supported if you like hierarchies.
* **History of changes** for textual parts of hyphae. Every change is safely stored in [Git]. Web feeds for recent changes included.
* **Keyboard-driven navigation.** Press `?` to see the list of shortcuts.
* **Support for [authorization].** Both plain username-password pairs and [Telegram]'s login widget are supported.
* **[Open Graph] support.** The most relevant info about a hypha is made available through OG meta tags for consumption by other software.
